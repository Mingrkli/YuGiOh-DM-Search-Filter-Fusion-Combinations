# YuGiOh-DM-Search-Filter-Fusion-Combinations

Welcome to my personal project that I created. I was playing a game called _Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters II: Dark Duel Stories_, which features fusion cards. Fusion allows you to combine two materials to create a new card. However, when looking online for a list, I found over **56,616** different fusion combinations, making it difficult to navigate. So, I decided to create this project to help myself and anyone else who needs a way to filter materials and quickly find what they can currently create.

## Features

-   Loads a **.txt** file of your choice (in the correct format)
-   Search bar to **add cards** from your deck or select specific cards to filter
-   Filtered list **displays all possible fusions** based on the selected materials

## Txt File Format

The `.txt` file should follow this format:

```
material1 + material2 = result
```

For example:

```
Dragon + Zombie = Curse of Dragon
Fiend + Spellcaster = Dark Magician
```

A file named **DM2-Fusion-List.txt** is included in the project, containing every fusion from _Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters II: Dark Duel Stories_. This serves as an example of the correct format.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a `.txt` file** in the correct format.
2. **Use the search bar** to add cards to your filtered list.
3. The app will **display all fusions** that can be created using the cards in your filtered list.

## Future Updates

-   Plan to convert this into a **desktop app using Electron** to make it easier to use for non-developers.

## Contributions

This is a personal project, but if you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, feel free to submit issues or pull requests!

Enjoy filtering your **Yu-Gi-Oh!** fusions efficiently! ðŸš€
